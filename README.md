DLCProofreader is a standalone MATLAB program for revising and annotating tracking data from [https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut](DeepLabCut.)

While usable, it is not (yet) well documented and has some serious bugs. Most notably the resize function does not do a good job of boundary-condition checking at lower resolutions. Runs best maximized at 1600x900 and up.
